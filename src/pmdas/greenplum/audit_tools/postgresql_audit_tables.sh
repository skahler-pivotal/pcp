# This script prints the column names for each of the  postgresql pg_stat
# tables that are probed by the PCP pmdapostgresql(1) PMDA. To audit and
# verify a particular version of postgresql for compatibility with the PCP
# PMDA, run this script and diff the output with the qualified listing
# that most closely matches the version of postgresql server that you are
# using, e.g. postgres_pg_stat_tables.9.6.7 in this directory is currently
# the highest version supported. Any differences need to be investigated
# because the PMDA is sensitive to the order of columns in each of the
# tables that it probes (this may be relaxed some day by using more specific
# select commands that name each column).
#
# Note: this script assumes you already have the postgresql service enabled,
# configured and started. If not, consult some instructions on how to do that,
# such as https://fedoramagazine.org/postgresql-quick-start-fedora-24/
